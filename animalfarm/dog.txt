==Etymology and related terminology==
The term "domestic dog" is generally used for both of the [[domesticated]] and [[feral]] varieties. The English word ''dog'' comes from [[Middle English]] ''dogge'', from [[Old English]] ''[[wikt:docga|docga]]'', a "powerful dog breed".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclocenter.com/Domestic-Pet-134.html|title=Domestic PetDog Classified By Linnaeus In 1758 As Canis Familiaris And Canis Familiarus Domesticus|publisher=www.encyclocentral.com|accessdate =18 June 2008}}</ref> The term may possibly derive from Proto-Germanic ''*dukkōn'', represented in Old English ''finger-docce'' ("finger-muscle").<ref>{{Cite book| last = Seebold|first = Elmar|title = Kluge.

In 14th-century England, ''[[hound]]'' (from {{lang-ang|hund}}) was the general word for all domestic canines, and ''dog'' referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the mastiff. It is believed this "dog" type was so common, it eventually became the prototype of the category "hound".<ref name="dog">{{Cite journal| last = Broz|first = Vlatko|title = Diachronic Investigations of False Friends|journal=Contemporary Linguistics (Suvremena lingvistika)|volume = 66|issue = 2|pages = 199–222|year = 2008|url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=48370&lang=en}}</ref> By the 16th century, ''dog'' had become the general word, and ''hound'' had begun to refer only to types used for hunting.<ref>{{Cite book|author1=René Dirven|author2=Marjolyn Verspoor|title=Cognitive exploration of language and linguistics|year=2004|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-90-272-1906-0|pages=215–216|url=http://books.google.com/?id=uZcs6poXkfEC&pg=PA215 }}</ref>  ''Hound'', [[cognate (etymology)|cognate]] to German ''Hund'', Dutch ''hond'', common Scandinavian ''hund'', and Icelandic ''hundur'', is ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European ''*kwon-'' "dog", found in [[Sanskrit]] ''kukuur (कुक्कुर)'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&beginning=0+&tinput=+dog&trans=Translate&direction=AU|title=Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit|author=Klaus Glashoff|work=spokensanskrit.de}}</ref> Welsh ''ci'' (plural ''cwn''), [[Latin]] ''canis'', Greek ''kýōn'', and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''šuõ''.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE259.html| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061018073726/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE259.html| archivedate = 18 October 2006| title = The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition| accessdate =30 November 2006| publisher=www.bartleby.com}}</ref>

In breeding circles, a male canine is referred to as a dog, while a female is called a bitch<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dog |title=Dog |publisher=[[Dictionary.com]]}}</ref> (Middle English ''bicche'', from Old English ''bicce'', ultimately from Old Norse ''bikkja''). A group of offspring is a [[litter (animal)|litter]]. The father of a litter is called the sire, and the mother is called the dam. Offspring are, in general, called pups or [[puppy|puppies]], from French ''poupée'', until they are about a year old. The process of birth is whelping, from the Old English word ''hwelp'' (cf. German ''Welpe'', Dutch ''welp'', Swedish ''valpa'', Icelandic ''hvelpur'').<ref>{{Cite book|author=Gould, Jean |title=All about dog breeding for quality and soundness |publisher=Pelham |location=London, Eng |year=1978 |isbn=0-7207-1064-2}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> The term "whelp" can also be used to refer to the young of any canid, or as a (somewhat archaic) alternative to "puppy".

==Taxonomy==
In 1753, [[Carl Linnaeus]] listed among the types of [[quadruped]]s familiar to him the Latin word for dog, ''canis''. Among the species within this genus, Linnaeus listed the [[red fox]] (as ''Canis vulpes''), [[wolves]] (''Canis lupus''), and the domestic dog (''Canis canis''). In later editions, Linnaeus dropped ''Canis canis'' and greatly expanded his list of the ''Canis'' genus of quadrupeds, and by 1758 included alongside the [[fox]]es, wolves, and [[Canis aureus|jackals]] and many more terms that are now listed as synonyms for domestic dog, including ''aegyptius'' (hairless dog), ''aquaticus'', ([[water dog]]), and ''mustelinus'' (literally "[[badger dog]]"). Among these were two that later experts have been widely used for domestic dogs as a species: ''Canis domesticus'' and, most predominantly, ''Canis familiaris'', the "common" or "familiar" dog.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Linnaeus| first = Carolus| authorlink = Carolus Linnaeus| title = Systema naturae per regna tria naturae:secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.| publisher=Holmiae (Laurentii Salvii)| year = 1758| page = 38| url = http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/726931| accessdate =8 September 2008| volume = 1| edition = 10th}}</ref>

By 1993 with advancements in [[molecular biology]], the mitochondrial DNA [[mtDNA]] analysis of extant (i.e. living today) Canidea species indicated that "The domestic dog is an extremely close relative of the gray wolf, differing from it by at most 0.2% of mtDNA sequence....

In 2014, a [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] study of extant and extinct dog and wolf specimens raised a question about the appropriateness of this classification. Refer to [[Dog#Origin|origin]] and [[Gray wolf#Relationship to the dog|gray wolf]].

==Origin==
{{Main|Origin of the domestic dog}}

<!--Note: What is reflected in this section must be in accord with what is on the "Origin of the domestic dog" page and the "Gray wolf" page (sub-heading "Relationship to the domestic dog"). Unless you have some subject knowledge on the topic, please don't tinker – if you are dog-kind then take your concerns to the "Origin of the domestic dog" Talk page, or wolf-kind take it to the "Gray wolf" Talk page – all of your queries will be eventually answered.-->
The origin of the domestic dog (''Canis lupus familiaris'' or ''Canis familiaris'') is not clear. [[Nuclear DNA]] evidence points to a single [[domestication]] 11,000-16,000 years ago that predates the rise of agriculture and implies that the earliest dogs arose along with [[hunter-gatherer]]s and not agriculturists.<ref name=freedman2014/> [[Mitochondrial DNA]] evidence points to a domestication 18,800-32,100 years ago and that all modern dogs are most closely related to ancient wolf fossils that have been found in Europe,<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=Wolpert2013/> compared to earlier hypotheses which proposed origins in [[Eurasia]] as well as [[Eastern Asia]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Dogs: Their Fossil Relatives and Evolutionary History|pages=233–236|first=Xiaoming|last=Wang|publisher=Columbia University Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Dog Behaviour, Evolution, and Cognition|page=167|first=Ãdám|last=Miklósi|publisher=Oxford}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Cossins  | first = Dan | title = Dogs and Human Evolving Together | newspaper = The Scientist | url = http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/35585/title/Dogs-and-Human-Evolving-Together/ | date = May 16, 2013| accessdate = January 12, 2014}}</ref> The 2 recent genetic analyses indicate that the dog is not a descendant of the extant (i.e. living) [[Gray wolf#Relationship to the dog|gray wolf]] but forms a sister [[clade]], that the ancestor is an extinct [[Origin of the domestic dog#Descendant of other canids that exist today|wolf-like canid]]
and the dog's genetic closeness to modern wolves is due to [[Genetic admixture|admixture]].<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=Viegas2014/>

The archaeological and morphological evidence from several ancient dog-like fossils, such as the 36,000 year old Goyet specimen from Belgium and the 33,000 year old Altai Mountains specimen from Central Asia, indicates that domestication may have begun earlier than the genetic evidence points to and arose in multiple locations.<ref name=ovodov2011/> It has been proposed that based on the morphological similarity between these and other early specimens compared to later prehistoric dogs dated to 15,000 years BP, that these specimens might have provided the stock from which dogs later evolved.<ref name=Germonpre2009/>

[[File:Dog anatomy lateral skeleton view.jpg|thumb|250px|Lateral view of skeleton.]]
Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.<ref name="ADW"/> Modern [[dog breed]]s show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal. Nevertheless, their morphology is based on that of their wild wolf ancestors.<ref name="ADW"/>
Dogs are [[predation|predators]] and [[scavenger]]s, and like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.

Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a [[Yorkshire Terrier]], that stood only {{convert|6.3|cm|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, {{convert|9.5|cm|abbr=on}} in length along the head-and-body, and weighed only {{convert|113|g}}. The largest known dog was an [[English Mastiff]] which weighed {{convert|155.6|kg|abbr=on}} and was {{convert|250|cm|abbr=on}} from the snout to the tail.<ref name="zorba">{{cite web|url=http://worldslargestdog1.com/zorba2/|title=World's Largest Dog|accessdate=7 January 2008}}</ref> The tallest dog is a [[Great Dane]] that stands {{convert|106.7|cm|abbr=on}} at the shoulder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/natural_world/fantastic_pets/tallest_dog_living.aspx |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110711133443/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/natural_world/fantastic_pets/tallest_dog_living.aspx |archivedate=11 July 2011 |title=Guinness World Records – Tallest Dog Living |accessdate=7 January 2009 |publisher=Guinness World Records |date=31 August 2004}}</ref>

Dogs have a [[temporal resolution]] of between 60 and 70&nbsp;Hz.

As [[crepuscular]] hunters, dogs often rely on their vision in low light situations: They have very large pupils, a high density of [[rod cell|rods]] in the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]], an increased flicker rate, and a [[tapetum lucidum]].<ref name="coren"/> The tapetum is a reflective surface behind the retina that reflects light to give the photoreceptors a second chance to catch the photons. There is also a relationship between body size and overall diameter of the eye. A range of 9.5 and 11.6&nbsp;mm can be found between various breeds of dogs. This 20% variance can be substantial and is associated as an adaptation toward superior night vision.<ref>Miklósi, p. 139.</ref>

Some [[cephalic index#Dolichocephalic animals|long-muzzled]] breeds, in particular, the [[sighthound]]s, have a field of vision up to 270° (compared to 180° for humans). Short-nosed breeds, on the other hand, have an "area centralis": a central patch with up to three times the density of nerve endings as the visual streak, giving them detailed sight much more like a human's. Some [[Cephalic index#Brachycephalic animals|broad-headed]] breeds with short noses have a field of vision similar to that of humans.<ref name="note1" /><ref name="note2" />

Most breeds have [[emmetropic|good vision]], but some show a [[genetic predisposition]] for [[myopia]] – such as [[Rottweiler]]s, with which one out of every two has been found to be [[myopia in animals|myopic]].<ref name="coren"/> Dogs also have a greater divergence of the eye axis than humans, enabling them to rotate their pupils farther in any direction. The divergence of the eye axis of dogs ranges from 12–25° depending on the breed.<ref name="Mech, David 2006, p. 98"/>

Experimentation has proven that dogs can distinguish between complex visual images such as that of a cube or a prism. Dogs also show attraction to static visual images such as the silhouette of a dog on a screen, their own reflections, or videos of dogs; however, their interest declines sharply once they are unable to make social contact with the image.<ref>Miklósi, p. 142.</ref>

====Hearing====
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals The ear.jpg|thumb|right |250px|Anatomy of the ear.]]
The frequency range of dog hearing is approximately 40&nbsp;Hz to 60,000&nbsp;Hz,<ref name="Physics Factbook">{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/TimCondon.shtml|title=Frequency Range of Dog Hearing|last=Elert|first=Glenn|author2=Timothy Condon|year=2003|publisher=The Physics Factbook|accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref> which means that dogs can detect sounds far beyond the upper limit of the human auditory spectrum.<ref name="note2" /><ref name="Physics Factbook" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lsu.edu/deafness/HearingRange.html|accessdate=7 January 2008|title=How well do dogs and other animals hear}}</ref> In addition, dogs have ear mobility, which allows them to rapidly pinpoint the exact location of a sound.<ref name="Dog Sense of Hearing" /> Eighteen or more muscles can tilt, rotate, raise, or lower a dog's ear.

====Smell====
[[File:Dog nose.jpg|thumb|The wet, textured [[Olfactory system|nose]] of a dog]]

While the human brain is dominated by a large [[visual cortex]], the dog brain is dominated by an [[olfactory system|olfactory cortex]].<ref name="coren"/> The [[olfactory bulb]] in dogs is roughly forty times bigger than the olfactory bulb in humans, relative to total brain size, with 125 to 220&nbsp;million smell-sensitive receptors.<ref name="coren"/> The [[bloodhound]] exceeds this standard with nearly 300&nbsp;million receptors.<ref name="coren"/>

Consequently, it has been estimated that dogs, in general, have an olfactory sense ranging from one hundred thousand to one million times more sensitive than a human's. In some dog breeds, such as bloodhounds, the olfactory sense may be up to 100 million times greater than a human's.<ref name="nhm.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.org/exhibitions/dogs/formfunction/smell.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080801101136/http://www.nhm.org/exhibitions/dogs/formfunction/smell.html|archivedate=1 August 2008|title=Smell|date=6 May 2004|publisher=nhm.org|accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref> The wet nose, or [[rhinarium]], is essential for determining the direction of the air current containing the smell.

[[File:Poligraf Poligrafovich.JPG|thumb|upright|A heavy winter coat with countershading in a [[mixed-breed dog]]]]
The [[pelage|coats]] of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" being common with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse [[guard hair]] and a soft [[down hair]], or "single", with the topcoat only.

Domestic dogs often display the remnants of [[countershading]], a common natural camouflage pattern.

====Tail====
{{See also|Docking (dog)|label 1=Docking}}
There are many different shapes for [[dog tail]]s: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or cork-screw. As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be important in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally [[docking (dog)|docked]] to avoid injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdb.org/case4dock.htm|title=The Case for Tail Docking|publisher=Council of Docked Breeds|accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref> In some breeds, such as the [[Braque du Bourbonnais]], puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.braquedubourbonnais.info/en/tail-genetics.htm |title=Bourbonnais pointer or 'short tail pointer' |publisher=Braquedubourbonnais.info |accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref>

===Health===
{{Main|Dog health|CVBD}}

Dogs are susceptible to various diseases, ailments, and poisons, [[zoonosis|some of which can affect humans]]. To defend against many common diseases, dogs are often [[vaccination of dogs|vaccinated]].

There are many household plants that are poisonous to dogs including [[begonia]], [[Poinsettia]] and [[aloe vera]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunset.com/garden/flowers-plants/plants-poisonous-to-dogs-00418000068562/|title=Plants poisonous to dogs – Sunset|work=Sunset}}</ref> [[Poinsettia]] is often claimed to be toxic but this is untrue.

Some breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments such as [[Elbow dysplasia|elbow]] and [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], [[blindness]], [[deafness]], [[pulmonary valve stenosis|pulmonic stenosis]], [[cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]], and [[luxating patella|trick knees]]. Two serious medical conditions particularly affecting dogs are [[pyometra]], affecting [[neutering|unspayed]] females of all types and ages, and [[bloat]], which affects the larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions, and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as [[flea]]s, [[tick]]s, and [[mite]]s, as well as [[hookworms]], [[tapeworms]], [[roundworms]], and [[Dirofilaria immitis|heartworms]].

A number of common human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including [[chocolate|chocolate solids]] ([[theobromine poisoning]]), onion and [[garlic]] ([[thiosulphate]], [[sulfoxide]] or [[disulfide]] poisoning),<ref>Sources vary on which of these are considered the most significant toxic item.</ref> [[grape]]s and [[raisin]]s, [[macadamia nut]]s, [[xylitol]],<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.cvsm.2011.12.003}}</ref> as well as various plants and other potentially ingested materials.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toxic Foods and Plants for Dogs|url=http://www.entirelypets.com/toxicfoods.html|publisher=entirelypets.com|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Drs.

Dogs can get it by scavenging in garbage or ashtrays; eating cigars and cigarettes. Signs can be vomiting of large amounts (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. Some other signs are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fogle |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Fogle |year=1974 |title=Caring For Your Dog}}</ref> Dogs are highly susceptible to [[theobromine poisoning]], typically from ingestion of [[chocolate]]. Theobromine is toxic to dogs because, although the dog's metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so slow that even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, especially dark chocolate.

Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including [[diabetes in dogs|diabetes]], dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dogtime.com/diseases-shared-by-humans-pets-ernie-ward.html|title=Diseases shared by humans and pets|author=Ward, Dr. Ernie|publisher=Dogtime.com|accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref>

====Lifespan====
[[File:Terrier mixed-breed dog.jpg|thumb|A mixed-breed terrier. Mixed-breed dogs are generally healthier than pure-breds. (See [[heterosis]])]]

The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most the median longevity, the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive, ranges from 10 to 13 years.<ref name="KC Survey">

Because of the [[overpopulation in companion animals|overpopulation of dogs]] in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may have to later be euthanized.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/spayneuter/ | title=Top 10 reasons to spay/neuter your pet | publisher=American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals | accessdate =16 May 2007}}</ref>

According to the [[Humane Society of the United States]], 3–4&nbsp;million dogs and cats are [[euthanasia|put down]] each year in the United States and many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down.<ref>{{Cite journal | quote = Although the cause of pet overpopulation is multifaceted, the lack of guardians choosing to spay or neuter their animals is a major contributing factor. | last = Mahlow | first = Jane C. | year = 1999 | title = Estimation of the proportions of dogs and cats that are surgically sterilized | journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association | volume = 215 | pages = 640–643 | pmid= 10476708 | issue = 5}}</ref> Local humane societies, SPCAs, and other [[animal protection organizations]] urge people to neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them.

==Intelligence, behavior and communication==

===Intelligence===
{{Main|Dog intelligence}}

[[File:Border Collie liver portrait.jpg|thumb|The [[Border Collie]] is considered to be one of the most intelligent breeds.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{Cite book| last=Coren | first=Stanley | title=The Intelligence of Dogs: A Guide to the Thoughts, Emotions, and Inner Lives of Our Canine Companions | publisher=Bantam Books | isbn=0-553-37452-4 | year=1995 }}</ref>]]
The domestic dog has a predisposition to exhibit a social intelligence that is uncommon in the animal world.<ref name="coren"/> Dogs are capable of learning in a number of ways, such as through simple [[reinforcement learning|reinforcement]] (e.g., [[classical conditioning|classical]] or [[operant conditioning]]) and by observation.<ref name="coren"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naiaonline.org/articles/article/how-dogs-learn1|title=How Dogs Learn|publisher=National Animal Interest Alliance|accessdate=4 July 2014}}</ref>

Dogs go through a series of stages of cognitive development. As with [[human]]s, the understanding that objects not being actively perceived still remain in existence (called [[object permanence]]) is not present at birth. It develops as the young dog learns to interact intentionally with objects around it, at roughly 8 weeks of age.<ref name="coren"/>

Puppies learn behaviors quickly by following examples set by experienced dogs.<ref name="coren"/> This form of intelligence is not peculiar to those tasks dogs have been bred to perform, but can be generalized to myriad abstract problems. For example, Dachshund puppies that watched an experienced dog pull a cart by tugging on an attached piece of ribbon in order to get a reward from inside the cart learned the task fifteen times faster than those left to solve the problem on their own.<ref name="coren"/><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/dev.420100310|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|volume =10|issue=3|pages= 267–271|year=2004|title = Ontogeny of observational learning in the dog (Canis familiaris)|author=Adler, Leonore Loeb and Adler, Helmut E. |pmid=863122}}</ref>

Dogs can also learn by mimicking human behaviors. In one study, puppies were presented with a box, and shown that, when a handler pressed a lever, a ball would roll out of the box. The handler then allowed the puppy to play with the ball, making it an intrinsic reward. The pups were then allowed to interact with the box. Roughly three quarters of the puppies subsequently touched the lever, and over half successfully released the ball, compared to only 6% in a control group that did not watch the human manipulate the lever.<ref name="hungary">{{Cite journal|author=Kubinyi, E., Topal, J., & Miklosi, A. |year=2003|title=Dogs (canis familiaris) learn their owners via observation in a manipulation task|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.117.2.156|volume=117|pages=156–165|issue=2}}</ref> Another study found that handing an object between experimenters who then used the object's name in a sentence successfully taught an observing dog each object's name, allowing the dog to subsequently retrieve the item.<ref name="mckinley">{{Cite journal|title=The efficacy of the model-rival method when compared to operant conditioning for training domestic dogs to perform a retrieval-selection task|journal=AABS|year=2003|doi=10.1016/S0168-1591(02)00277-0|last1=McKinley|first1=Sue|last2=Young|first2=Robert J|volume=81|issue=4|pages=357–365}}</ref>

[[File:Sergeant Stubby 3.jpg|thumb|[[Sergeant Stubby]] wearing his uniform and medals. Stubby participated in four offensives and 17 battles.]]
Dogs also demonstrate sophisticated [[social cognition]] by associating behavioral cues with abstract meanings.<ref name="coren"/> One such class of social cognition involves the understanding that others are conscious agents. Research has shown that dogs are capable of interpreting subtle social cues, and appear to recognize when a human or dog's attention is focused on them. To test this, researchers devised a task in which a reward was hidden underneath one of two buckets. The experimenter then attempted to communicate with the dog to indicate the location of the reward by using a wide range of signals: tapping the bucket, pointing to the bucket, nodding to the bucket, or simply looking at the bucket.<ref name="hare">{{Cite journal|author=Hare, B., Brown, M., Williamson, C., & Tomasello, M.|date=Nov 2002|title=The domestication of social cognition in dogs|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.1072702|volume=298|pmid=12446914|issue=5598|pages=1634–6|issn=0036-8075|bibcode = 2002Sci...298.1634H }}</ref>{{rp|pages=1634–6}} The results showed that domestic dogs were better than [[chimpanzee]]s, wolves, and human infants at this task, and even young puppies with limited exposure to humans performed well.<ref name="coren"/>

Psychology research has shown that humans' gaze instinctively moves to the left in order to watch the right side of a person's face, which is related to use of right hemisphere brain for facial recognition, including human facial emotions. Research at the [[University of Lincoln]] (2008) shows that dogs share this instinct when meeting a human being, and only when meeting a human being (i.e., not other animals or other dogs). As such they are the only non-[[primate]] species known to do so.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=K Guo, C Hall, S Hall, K Meints, D Mills|title=Left gaze bias in human infants, rhesus monkeys, and domestic dogs|journal=Perception|year=2007|volume=36 ECVP|url=http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=v070385|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|title=Dogs can read emotion in human faces|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3354028/Dogs-can-read-emotion-in-human-faces.html|accessdate=24 June 2010|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=29 October 2008|location=London}}</ref>

[[Stanley Coren]], an expert on dog psychology, states that these results demonstrated the social cognition of dogs can exceed that of even our closest genetic relatives, and that this capacity is a recent genetic acquisition that distinguishes the dog from the wolf.<ref name="coren"/> Studies have also investigated whether dogs engaged in partnered play change their behavior depending on the attention-state of their partner.<ref name="ach">{{Cite journal|title= Attention to attention in domestic dog (Canis familiaris) dyadic play|journal=Journal Animal Cognition|publisher=Springer Berlin / Heidelberg|volume=12|year=2009|doi=10.1007/s10071-008-0175-y|author= Horowitz, Alexandra|pages= 107–18|pmid=18679727|issue=1}}</ref> Those studies showed that play signals were only sent when the dog was holding the attention of its partner. If the partner was distracted, the dog instead engaged in attention-getting behavior before sending a play signal.<ref name="ach"/>

Coren has also argued that dogs demonstrate a sophisticated theory of mind by engaging in deception, which he supports with a number of anecdotes, including one example wherein a dog hid a stolen treat by sitting on it until the rightful owner of the treat left the room.<ref name="coren"/> Although this could have been accidental, Coren suggests that the thief understood that the treat's owner would be unable to find the treat if it were out of view. Together, the empirical data and [[anecdotal evidence]] points to dogs possessing at least a limited form of [[theory of mind]].<ref name="coren"/><ref name="ach"/> Similar research has been performed by Brian Hare of [[Duke University]], who has shown that dogs outperform both great apes as well as wolves raised by humans in reading human communicative signals.<ref name="hare"/>{{rp|pages=1634–6}}<ref name=Zimmer>{{cite news|last=Zimmer|first=Carl|title=A Virtual Pack, to Study Canine Minds|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/23/science/enlisting-a-virtual-pack-to-study-dog-minds.html|accessdate=30 April 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=22 April 2013}}</ref>

Dogs can discriminate the emotional expressions of human faces.<ref name=muller2015/>

===Behavior===
{{Main|Dog behavior}}

Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli.<ref name=levitis2009/> As the oldest domesticated species, with estimates ranging from 9,000–30,000 years BCE, the minds of dogs inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and they are uniquely attuned to our behaviors.<ref name=berns2012/> Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the otherwise humble domestic dog. These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine 
relatives nor by other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes. Rather, these skills parallel some of the social-cognitive skills of human children.<ref name=tomasello2009/> 

===Communication===
{{Main|Dog communication}}

By the age of four weeks, the dog has developed the majority of its vocalizations.<ref name="Fox">{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Michael W.|title=Behaviour of Wolves, Dogs, and Related Canids|year=1971|publisher=Harper & Row|location=New York|isbn=0-89874-686-8|pages=183–206|edition=1st United States}}</ref> The dog is the most vocal canid and is unique in its tendency to bark in a myriad of situations.<ref name="Fox"/>

Barking appears to have little more communication functions than excitement, fighting, the presence of a human, or simply because other dogs are barking.<ref name="Fox"/> Subtler signs such as discreet bodily and facial movements, body odors, whines, yelps, and growls are the main sources of actual communication.<ref name="Fox"/> The majority of these subtle communication techniques are employed at a close proximity to another, but for long-range communication only barking and howling are employed.<ref name="Fox"/>

====Dog growl====
A new study in Budapest, Hungary, has found that dogs are able to tell how big another dog is just by listening to its growl. A specific growl is used by dogs to protect their food. The research also shows that dogs do not, or can not, misrepresent their size, and this is the first time research has shown animals can determine another's size by the sound it makes. The test, using images of many kinds of dogs, showed a small and big dog and played a growl. The result showed that 20 of the 24 test dogs looked at the image of the appropriately sized dog first and looked at it longest.<ref name=Farag>{{cite journal|last=Faragó|first=T|title=Dogs' Expectation about Signalers' Body Size by Virtue of Their Growls|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2010|volume=5|issue=12|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0015175|pages=e15175|pmid=21179521|pmc=3002277|bibcode = 2010PLoSO...515175F|author2=Pongrácz P|author3=Miklósi Á|author4=Huber L|author5=Virányi Z| last6=Range|first6=F|editor1-last=Giurfa|editor1-first=Martin}}</ref> Additionally, most people can tell from a bark whether a dog was alone or being approached by a stranger, playing or being aggressive,<ref name=hare2013/> and able tell from a growl how big the dog is.<ref name=sanderson2008/> This is thought to be evidence of [[Origin of the domestic dog#Human-dog coevolution|human-dog coevolution]].<ref name=sanderson2008/>

==Differences from wolves==
[[File:Timba+1.jpg|thumb|Some dogs, like this [[Tamaskan Dog]], look very much like wolves.]]

===Physical characteristics===
{{Further|Wolf}}
Compared to equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls, 30% smaller brains,<ref name="serpell1995" />{{rp|35}} as well as proportionately smaller teeth than other canid species.<ref name="DOGS">{{Cite book| author=Coppinger, Ray|title=Dogs: a Startling New Understanding of Canine Origin, Behavior and Evolution|year=2001|isbn=0-684-85530-5|publisher=Scribner|location= New York}}</ref> Dogs require fewer calories to function than wolves. It is thought by certain experts that the dog's limp ears are a result of [[atrophy]] of the jaw muscles.<ref name="DOGS" /> The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some [[Inuit]] tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather.<ref name="DOGS" /> Wolves do not have [[dewclaw]]s on their back legs, unless there has been admixture with dogs.<ref>{{Citation | last = Rincon  | first = Paul | title = Claws reveal wolf survival threat | newspaper = BBC News | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3602741.stm | date = April 8, 2004 | accessdate = December 12, 2014}}</ref>

===Behavioral differences===

Dogs tend to be poorer than wolves at [[observational learning]], being more responsive to [[operant conditioning|instrumental conditioning]].<ref name="DOGS" /> Feral dogs show little of the complex social structure or [[dominance hierarchy]] present in wolf packs. For example, unlike wolves, the dominant alpha pairs of a feral dog pack do not force the other members to wait for their turn on a meal when scavenging off a dead ungulate as the whole family is free to join in. For dogs, other members of their kind are of no help in locating food items, and are more like competitors.<ref name="DOGS" />

Feral dogs are primarily scavengers, with studies showing that unlike their wild cousins, they are poor [[ungulate]] hunters, having little impact on wildlife populations where they are [[sympatric speciation|sympatric]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} However, feral dogs have been reported to be effective hunters of reptiles in the [[Galápagos Islands]],<ref name="serpell1995" />{{rp|267}} and free ranging pet dogs are more prone to predatory behavior toward wild animals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Domestic dogs can be [[monogamy|monogamous]].<ref name="Pal">{{Cite journal|author=Pal SK |title=Parental care in free-ranging dogs, Canis familiaris |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=31–47 |date=January 2005 |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2004.08.002}}</ref> Breeding in feral packs can be, but does not have to be restricted to a dominant alpha pair (such things also occur in wolf packs).<ref>Günther Bloch: Die Pizza-Hunde. ISBN 978-3-440-10986-1</ref> Male dogs are unusual among canids by the fact that they mostly seem to play no role in raising their puppies, and do not kill the young of other females to increase their own reproductive success.<ref name="serpell1995" />{{rp|267}} Some sources say that dogs differ from wolves and most other large canid species by the fact that they do not regurgitate food for their young, nor the young of other dogs in the same [[territory (animal)|territory]].<ref name="DOGS" />

However, this difference was not observed in all domestic dogs. Regurgitating of food by the females for the young as well as care for the young by the males has been observed in domestic dogs, [[dingo]]s as well as in other feral or semi-feral dogs. Regurgitating of food by the females and direct choosing of only one mate has been observed even in those semi-feral dogs of direct domestic dog ancestry. Also regurgitating of food by males has been observed in free-ranging domestic dogs.<ref name="Pal"/><ref>Eberhard Trumler, Mit dem Hund auf du; Zum Verständnis seines Wesens und Verhaltens; 4. Auflage Januar 1996; R. Piper GmbH & Co. KG, München</ref>

In 1982, a study to observe the differences between dogs and wolves raised in similar conditions took place.<ref name= "Frank, Frank 1982"/> The dog puppies preferred larger amounts of sleep at the beginning of their lives, while the wolf puppies were much more active.<ref name= "Frank, Frank 1982"/> The dog puppies also preferred the company of humans, rather than their canine foster mother, though the wolf puppies were the exact opposite, spending more time with their foster mother.<ref name= "Frank, Frank 1982"/> The dogs also showed a greater interest in the food given to them and paid little attention to their surroundings, while the wolf puppies found their surroundings to be much more intriguing than their food or food bowl.<ref name= "Frank, Frank 1982"/> The wolf puppies were observed taking part in agonistic play at a younger age, while the dog puppies did not display dominant/submissive roles until they were much older.<ref name= "Frank, Frank 1982"/> The wolf puppies were rarely seen as being aggressive to each other or towards the other canines.<ref name= "Frank, Frank 1982"/> On the other hand, the dog puppies were much more aggressive to each other and other canines, often seen full-on attacking their foster mother or one another.<ref name= "Frank, Frank 1982"/>

Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as [[bite inhibition]], from their wolf ancestors, which would have been [[pack hunter]]s with complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations, and these attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful species on the planet today.<ref name="Miklósi">{{cite book|author=Miklósi, Adám |title=Dog Behaviour, Evolution, and Cognition|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KnVEIrVNGhIC|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929585-2|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199295852.001.0001}}</ref>{{rp|pages95-136}}

The dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as [[hunting dog|hunting]], [[herding dog|herding]], [[sled dog|pulling loads]], [[guard dog|protection]], [[police dog|assisting police]] and [[Dogs in warfare|military]], [[pet|companionship]], and, more recently, [[service dog|aiding handicapped individuals]]. This impact on human society has given them the nickname "[[Man's best friend (phrase)|man's best friend]]" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs [[#As a food source|are also a source of meat]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/2074073.stm | work=BBC News | first=Rupert | last=Wingfield-Hayes | title=China's taste for the exotic | date=29 June 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1735647.stm | work=BBC News | title=Vietnam's dog meat tradition | date=31 December 2001}}</ref>

===Early roles===
Wolves, and their dog descendants, would have derived significant benefits from living in human camps—more safety, more reliable food, lesser caloric needs, and more chance to breed.<ref name="Groves">{{Cite journal|last = Groves |first= Colin |year= 1999|title= The Advantages and Disadvantages of Being Domesticated | journal=Perspectives in Human Biology|volume = 4| pages = 1–12 | issn = 1038-5762}}</ref> They would have benefited from humans' upright gait that gives them larger range over which to see potential predators and prey, as well as color vision that, at least by day, gives humans better visual discrimination.<ref name=Groves/> Camp dogs would also have benefited from human tool use, as in bringing down larger prey and controlling fire for a range of purposes.<ref name=Groves/>

Humans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dogs associated with their camps.<ref name="Tacon">{{Cite journal|first1=Paul |last1=Tacon |first2=Colin |last2=Pardoe |year=2002 |title=Dogs make us human |journal=Nature Australia |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=52–61}}</ref> For instance, dogs would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food scraps.<ref name="Tacon"/> Dogs may have provided warmth, as referred to in the Australian Aboriginal expression "three dog night" (an exceptionally cold night), and they would have alerted the camp to the presence of predators or strangers, using their acute hearing to provide an early warning.<ref name="Tacon"/>

Anthropologists believe the most significant benefit would have been the use of dogs' robust sense of smell to assist with the hunt.<ref name="Tacon"/> The relationship between the presence of a dog and success in the hunt is often mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of the wolf, and a 2004 study of hunter groups with and without a dog gives quantitative support to the hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting was an important factor in wolf domestication.<ref name="Ruusila">{{Cite journal|first1=Vesa |last1=Ruusila |first2=Mauri |last2=Pesonen|year=2004 |title=Interspecific cooperation in human (''Homo sapiens'') hunting: the benefits of a barking dog (''Canis familiaris'') |journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=545–9 |url=http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf41/anzf41-545.pdf}}</ref>

The majority of contemporary people with dogs describe their pet as part of the family,<ref name="Power" /> although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog–human family as a pack.<ref name="Power"/> A [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]] model of dog–human relationships has been promoted by some dog trainers, such as on the television program ''[[Dog Whisperer]]''.

According to statistics published by the [[American Pet Products Manufacturers Association]] in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009–2010, it is estimated there are 77.5&nbsp;million people with pet dogs in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/pet_ownership_statistics.html| title=U.S. Pet Ownership Statistics|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref> The same survey shows nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% two dogs and nearly 9% more than two dogs. There does not seem to be any gender preference among dogs as pets, as the statistical data reveal an equal number of female and male dog pets. Yet, although several programs are undergoing to promote [[pet adoption]], less than a fifth of the owned dogs come from a shelter.

The latest study using [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) to humans and dogs together proved that dogs have same response to voices and use the same parts of the brain as humans to do so.

===Sports and shows===
{{See also|Conformation show}}
People often enter their dogs in competitions<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/events/conformation/beginners.cfm|title=A Beginner's Guide to Dog Shows|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=30 October 2008}}</ref> such as breed-conformation shows or [[list of dog sports|sports]], including racing, sledding and agility competitions.

In conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in the breed standard. As the breed standard only deals with the externally observable qualities of the dog (such as appearance, movement, and temperament), separately tested qualities (such as ability or health) are not part of the judging in conformation shows.

The most popular Korean dog dish is ''[[bosintang|gaejang-guk]]'' (also called ''bosintang''), a spicy stew meant to balance the body's heat during the summer months; followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one's ''[[Qi|gi]]'', or vital energy of the body. A 19th century version of ''gaejang-guk'' explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with [[scallion]]s and chili powder. Variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots. While the dishes are still popular in Korea with a segment of the population, dog is not as widely consumed as beef, chicken, and pork.<ref name="pettid"/>

A CNN report in China dated March 2010 includes an interview with a dog meat vendor who stated that most of the dogs that are available for selling to [[restaurant]]s are raised in special farms but that there is always a chance that a sold dog is someone's lost pet, although dog pet breeds are not considered edible.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/03/09/china.animals/index.html| title=Inside the cat and dog meat market in China|date=9 March 2010|accessdate=24 June 2010 |publisher=CNN}}</ref>

Other cultures, such as [[Polynesia]] and [[pre-Columbian Mexico]], also consumed dog meat in their history. However, Western, South Asian, African, and Middle Eastern cultures, in general, regard consumption of dog meat as [[taboo food and drink|taboo]].

For example, in China, local economy revolved around agriculture in ancient times. Dogs didn't play a big role like Europe. On the contrary, every ancient Chinese government instituted some protective policies for farm cattle, even illegal to be slaughtered in some cases. In this way, some Chinese think Westerners are pressing their own values on them. They claimed dogs are not born to be companions for them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Earlier studies have shown that people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit better mental and physical health than those who do not, making fewer visits to the doctor and being less likely to be on medication than non-guardians.<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Headey B.|year = 1999|title = Health benefits and health cost savings due to pets: preliminary estimates from an Australian national survey|journal=Social Indicators Research|volume = 47|pages = 233–243|doi = 10.1023/A:1006892908532| issue=2 }}</ref>

A 2005 paper states "recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced use of general practitioner services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people. Research has, however, pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school through sickness among children who live with pets."<ref name="Pet ownership and human health: a brief review of evidence and issues"/> In one study, new guardians reported a highly significant reduction in minor health problems during the first month following pet acquisition, and this effect was sustained in those with dogs through to the end of the study.<ref name="autogenerated717">{{cite journal |author=Serpell J |title=Beneficial effects of pet ownership on some aspects of human health and behaviour |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=84 |issue=12 |pages=717–20 |year=1991 |pmid=1774745 |pmc=1295517}}</ref>

In addition, people with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats and those without pets. The group without pets exhibited no statistically significant changes in health or behaviour. The results provide evidence that keeping pets may have positive effects on human health and behaviour, and that for guardians of dogs these effects are relatively long-term.<ref name="autogenerated717"/> Pet guardianship has also been associated with increased coronary artery disease survival, with human guardians being significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who did not own dogs.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Friedmann E, Thomas SA |title=Pet ownership, social support, and one-year survival after acute myocardial infarction in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) |journal=The American Journal of Cardiology |volume=76 |issue=17 |pages=1213–7 |year=1995 |pmid=7502998 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9149(99)80343-9}}</ref>

The health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, and not solely from having dogs as pets. For example, when in the presence of a pet dog, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1097/00005053-199108000-00006 |author=Wilson CC |title=The pet as an anxiolytic intervention |journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=179 |issue=8 |pages=482–9 |year=1991 |pmid=1856711}}</ref> Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which, according to the [[hygiene hypothesis]], can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases. The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs are able to not only provide companionship and social support themselves, but also to act as facilitators of social interactions between humans.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=McNicholas |first1=J. |last2=Collis |first2=G.

===Medical detection dogs===
Medical detection dogs are capable of detecting diseases by sniffing a person of directly or samples of urine or other specimens. Dogs can detect odour in one part per trillion, as their brain's olfactory cortex is (relative to total brain size) 40 times larger than humans. Dogs may have as many as 300 million odour receptors in their nose, while humans may have only 5 million. Each dog is trained specifically for the detection of single disease from the blood glucose level indicative to diabetes to cancer. To train a cancer dog requires 6 months. A [[Labrador Retriever]] called Daisy has detected 551 cancer patients with an accuracy of 93 percent and received the Blue Cross (for pets) Medal for her life-saving skills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/telegraphchristmasappeal/11241191/How-my-dog-sniffed-out-breast-cancer-and-saved-my-life.html |title=How my dog sniffed out breast cancer and saved my lifeYYY |author=Terry Gasking |accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2843349/Medal-heroic-dog-sniffed-owner-s-cancer-Daisy-Labrador-helped-disease-551-patients.html |title=Medal for the heroic dog who sniffed out her owner's cancer: Daisy the Labrador has helped find disease in 551 patients |date=November 21, 2014}}</ref>
