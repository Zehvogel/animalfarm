'''Scorpions''' are [[predation|predatory]] [[arthropod]] animals of the order '''Scorpiones''' within the class [[Arachnid]]a. They have eight legs<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.scorpionworlds.com/|title= SCORPION FACTS AND INFORMATION|publisher=ScorpionWorlds|accessdate=19 February 2015}}</ref> and are easily recognised by the pair of grasping [[pedipalps]] and the narrow, segmented [[tail]], often carried in a characteristic forward curve over the back, ending with a [[venom]]ous [[stinger]]. Scorpions range in size from 9&nbsp;mm (''[[Typhlochactas mitchelli]]'') to 20&nbsp;cm (''[[Hadogenes troglodytes]]'').<ref>{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology |author=Edward E. Ruppert, Richard S. Fox, Robert D. Barnes |year=2004 |publisher=Brooks/Cole |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7}}</ref>

The evolutionary history of scorpions goes back to the [[Silurian]] era 430 million years ago. They have adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions and can now be found on all continents except [[Antarctica]]. Scorpions number about 1750 described [[species]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kovarex.com/scorpio/pdf/scorpions-Kovarik-2009.pdf |format=PDF |author=František Kovařík |year=2009 |title=Illustrated catalog of scorpions, Part I |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}</ref> with 13 extant families recognised to date.

==Geographical distribution==
Scorpions are found on all major land masses except Antarctica. Scorpions did not occur naturally in Great Britain, New Zealand and some of the islands in [[Oceania]], but now have been accidentally introduced in some of these places by human trade and commerce.<ref name="Biology"/>{{rp|249}} The greatest diversity of scorpions in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] is to be found in the subtropical areas lying between latitudes [[23rd parallel north|23° N]] and [[38th parallel north|38° N]]. Above these latitudes, the diversity decreases, with the northernmost natural occurrence of scorpions being the northern scorpion ''[[Paruroctonus boreus]]'' at Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada [[50th parallel north|50° N]].<ref name="Biology"/>{{rp|251}}

Today, scorpions are found in virtually every terrestrial [[habitat]], including high-elevation mountains, caves and intertidal zones, with the exception of [[boreal ecosystem]]s, such as the [[tundra]], high-altitude [[taiga]] and the permanently snow-clad tops of some mountains.<ref name="Biology"/>{{rp|251–252}}<ref>{{cite book |title=African biodiversity: molecules, organisms, ecosystems |author=Bernhard A.

[[File:Vista ventral de un escorpión.jpg|thumb|Ventral view of an unidentified scorpion species where the [[Pecten (biology)|pectines]] can easily be observed with a comb like structure in an inverted V shape.]]

The body of a scorpion is divided into three parts ([[Tagma (arthropod anatomy)|tagmata]]): the head ([[cephalothorax]]), the [[abdomen]] ([[mesosoma]]) and the tail ([[metasoma]]).<ref name="Biology"/>{{rp|10}}

===Cephalothorax===
The [[cephalothorax]], also called the ''[[prosoma]]'', comprises the [[carapace]], eyes, [[chelicerae]] (mouth parts), [[pedipalp]]s (the pedipalps of scorpions have [[chela (organ)|chelae]], commonly called claws or pincers) and four pairs of [[arthropod leg|walking legs]]. The scorpion's exoskeleton is thick and durable, providing good protection from predators. Scorpions have two eyes on the top of the cephalothorax, and usually two to five pairs of eyes along the front corners of the cephalothorax. The position of the eyes on the cephalothorax depends in part on the hardness or softness of the soil upon which they spend their lives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insects.tamu.edu/extension/bulletins/l-1678.html |title=Department of Entomology |publisher=[[Texas A&M University]] |accessdate=2012-05-03}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref>

The pedipalp is a segmented, chelate (clawed) [[appendage]] used for prey immobilisation, defence and sensory purposes. The segments of the pedipalp (from closest to the body outwards) are coxa, trochanter, femur (humerus), patella, tibia (including the fixed claw and the manus) and tarsus (moveable claw).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrbu.org/scorpions/sc_morphology/sc_glossary.html |title=WRBU Scorpion Identification |publisher=Wrbu.org |accessdate=2012-05-03}}</ref> A scorpion has darkened or granular raised linear ridges, called "keels" or ''carinae'' on the pedipalp segments and on other parts of the body, which are useful taxonomically.<ref name="Biology"/>{{rp|12}}

===Mesosoma===
The abdomen, also called the ''[[opisthosoma]]'', consists of seven segments ([[somites]]), each covered [[dorsum (biology)|dorsally]] by a sclerotosed plate ([[tergum]]) and also ventrally for segments 3 to 7. The first abdominal segment bears a pair of [[Genital operculum|genital opercula]] covering the [[gonopore]]. Segment 2 consists of the basal plate with the [[Pecten (biology)|pectines]], which are a pair of limbs transformed into sensory organs.<ref>Knowlton ED, Gaffin DD (June, 2011) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21647695 "Functionally redundant peg sensilla on the scorpion pecten"], ''NCBI''.</ref> Each of the mesosomal segments 3 to 7 have a pair of [[spiracles]], the openings for the scorpion's respiratory organs, known as [[book lungs]]. The spiracle openings may be slits, circular, elliptical, or oval.<ref name="Biology"/>{{rp|13–15}}

===Metasoma===
The metasoma, the scorpion's [[tail (anatomy)|tail]], comprises five caudal segments (the first tail segment looks like a last mesosoman segment) and the sixth bearing the  [[telson]] (the [[sting (biology)|sting]]). The telson, in turn, consists of the [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]], which holds a pair of [[venom]] glands, and the hypodermic aculeus, the venom-injecting barb.

On rare occasions, scorpions can be born with two metasomata (tails). Two-tailed scorpions are not a different species, merely a genetic abnormality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sasionline.org/pepe.htm |title=Pepe the Two Tailed Scorpion |accessdate=2008-06-13 |author=Steve Prchal |publisher=Sonoran Arthropod Studies Institute}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref>

==Fluorescence==
[[File:Sorpion Under Blacklight edit.jpg|thumb|This black scorpion appears light-blue under a [[black light]].]]

Scorpions are also known to glow a vibrant blue-green when exposed to certain wavelengths of [[ultraviolet]] light such as that produced by a [[black light]], due to the presence of fluorescent chemicals in the cuticle. One fluorescent component is now known to be [[beta-carboline]].<ref name="Stachel 1999 531–539">{{cite journal |author=Shawn J Stachel, Scott A Stockwell and David L Van Vranken |date=August 1999 |title=The fluorescence of scorpions and cataractogenesis |journal=[[Chemistry and Biology (journal)|Chemistry & Biology]] |volume=6 |pages=531–539 |doi=10.1016/S1074-5521(99)80085-4 |pmid=10421760 |issue=8}}</ref> A hand-held UV lamp has long been a standard tool for nocturnal field surveys of these animals.

They are [[nocturnal]] and [[fossorial]], finding shelter during the day in the relative cool of underground holes or undersides of rocks, and emerging at night to hunt and feed. Scorpions exhibit [[photophobia (biology)|photophobic]] behavior, primarily to evade detection by predators such as birds, centipedes, lizards, mice, possums and rats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amonline.net.au/factsheets/scorpions.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090302191244/http://amonline.net.au/factsheets/scorpions.htm |archivedate=2009-03-02 |title=Scorpions |accessdate=2008-06-13 |publisher=Australian Museum}}</ref>

Scorpions are opportunistic predators of small arthropods, although the larger kinds have been known to kill small lizards and mice. The large pincers are studded with highly sensitive tactile hairs, and the moment an insect touches these, they use their chelae (pincers) to catch the prey. Depending on the toxicity of their venom and size of their claws, they will then either crush the prey or inject it with [[neurotoxic]] venom. This will kill or paralyze the prey so the scorpion can eat it. Scorpions have an unusual style of eating using [[chelicerae]], small claw-like structures that protrude from the mouth that are unique to the [[Chelicerata]] among arthropods. The chelicerae, which are very sharp, are used to pull small amounts of food off the prey item for digestion into a ''pre-oral cavity'' below the chelicerae and carapace. Scorpions can ingest food only in a liquid form; they have external digestion. The digestive juices from the gut are egested onto the food and the digested food sucked in liquid form. Any solid indigestible matter (fur, [[exoskeleton]], etc.) is trapped by setae in the pre-oral cavity, which is ejected by the scorpion.<ref name="Biology"/>{{rp|296–297}}

Scorpions can consume huge amounts of food at one sitting. They have a very efficient food storage organ and a very low metabolic rate combined with a relatively inactive lifestyle. This enables scorpions to survive long periods when deprived of food; some are able to survive 6 to 12 months of starvation.<ref name="Biology"/>{{rp|297–298}} Scorpions excrete very little; their waste consists mostly of insoluble nitrogenous compounds such as [[xanthine]], [[guanine]] and [[uric acid]].<ref name="Earthlife"/>

===Reproduction===
Most scorpions reproduce sexually, and most species have male and female individuals. However, some species, such as ''[[Hottentotta hottentotta]]'', ''[[Hottentotta caboverdensis]]'', ''[[Liocheles australasiae]]'', ''[[Tityus columbianus]]'', ''[[Tityus metuendus]]'', ''[[Tityus serrulatus]]'', ''[[Tityus stigmurus]]'', ''[[Tityus trivittatus]]'' and ''[[Tityus urugayensis]]'', reproduce through [[parthenogenesis]], a process in which unfertilised eggs develop into living [[embryo]]s. Parthenogenic reproduction starts following the scorpion's final moult to maturity and continues thereafter.

Sexual reproduction is accomplished by the transfer of a [[spermatophore]] from the male to the female; scorpions possess a complex [[courtship]] and [[mating]] ritual to effect this transfer. Mating starts with the male and female locating and identifying each other using a mixture of [[pheromones]] and [[oscillation|vibrational]] communication. Once they have satisfied the other that they are of opposite sex and of the correct species, mating can commence.

The courtship starts with the male grasping the female's pedipalps with his own; the pair then perform a "dance" called the "''promenade à deux''". In this "dance," the male leads the female around searching for a suitable place to deposit his [[spermatophore]]. The courtship ritual can involve several other behaviours, such as [[juddering]] and a cheliceral kiss, in which the male's [[chelicerae]] – pincers – grasp the female's in a smaller more intimate version of the male's grasping the female's pedipalps and in some cases injecting a small amount of his venom into her pedipalp or on the edge of her cephalothorax,<ref>{{cite book |author=Cleveland P. Hickman Jr.; Larry S. Roberts, Allan Larson, Helen I'Anson, David Eisenhour |title=Integrated Principles of Zoology |edition=13 |date=2005-02-01 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math |isbn=978-0-07-310174-3 |page=380}}</ref> probably as a means of pacifying the female.

When the male has identified a suitable location, he deposits the spermatophore and then guides the female over it. This allows the spermatophore to enter her genital [[operculum (animal)|opercula]], which triggers release of the sperm, thus fertilising the female. The mating process can take from 1 to 25+ hours and depends on the ability of the male to find a suitable place to deposit his spermatophore. If mating continues too long, the female may lose interest, ending the process.

Once the mating is complete, the male and female will separate. The male will generally retreat quickly, most likely to avoid being cannibalised by the female, although [[sexual cannibalism]] is infrequent with scorpions.

===Birth and development===
[[File:scorpionwithyoung.JPG|right|thumb|''[[Compsobuthus werneri]]'' female with [[Offspring|young]]]]
Unlike the majority of species in the class [[Arachnid]]a, which are [[oviparous]], scorpions seem to be universally [[ovoviviparous]]. The young are born one by one after hatching and expelling the embryonic membrane, if any, and the brood is carried about on its mother's back until the young have undergone at least one [[ecdysis|moult]]. Before the first moult, scorplings cannot survive naturally without the mother, since they depend on her for protection and to regulate their moisture levels. Especially in species that display more advanced sociability (e.g. ''[[Pandinus]]'' spp.), the young/mother association can continue for an extended period of time. The size of the litter depends on the species and environmental factors, and can range from two to over a hundred scorplings. The average litter however, consists of around 8 scorplings.<ref>{{cite book |author=W. R. Lourenco |title=European Arachnology|chapter=Reproduction in scorpions, with special reference to parthenogenesis |year=2000|editor=S. Toft and N. Scharff |publisher=Aarhus University Press|isbn=877934 0016|pages=71–85 |url=http://www.european-arachnology.org/proceedings/19th/Lourenco.PDF}}</ref>

The young generally resemble their parents. Growth is accomplished by periodic shedding of the exoskeleton ([[ecdysis]]). A scorpion's developmental progress is measured in [[instars]] (how many moults it has undergone). Scorpions typically require between five and seven moults to reach maturity. Moulting commences with a split in the old [[exoskeleton]] just below the edge of the carapace (at the front of the prosoma). The scorpion then emerges from this split; the pedipalps and legs are first removed from the old exoskeleton, followed eventually by the [[metasoma]]. When it emerges, the scorpion's new [[exoskeleton]] is soft, making the scorpion highly vulnerable to attack. The scorpion must constantly stretch while the new exoskeleton hardens to ensure that it can move when the hardening is complete. The process of hardening is called [[sclerotisation]]. The new exoskeleton does not fluoresce; as sclerotisation occurs, the fluorescence gradually returns.

==Relationship with humans==

===Sting and venom===
All known scorpion species possess venom and use it primarily to kill or paralyze their prey so that it can be eaten. In general, it is fast-acting, allowing for effective prey capture. However, as a general rule they will kill their prey with brute force if they can, as opposed to using venom. It is also used as a defense against predators. The venom is a mixture of compounds (neurotoxins, enzyme inhibitors, etc.) each not only causing a different effect but possibly also targeting a specific animal. Each compound is made and stored in a pair of glandular sacs and is released in a quantity regulated by the scorpion itself. Of the 1,000+ known species of scorpion, only 25 have venom that is deadly to humans; most of those belong to the family [[Buthidae]] (including ''[[Leiurus quinquestriatus]]'', ''[[Hottentotta]]'', ''[[Centruroides]]'' and ''[[Androctonus]]'').<ref name="Earthlife"/><ref>{{cite web|title = ThinkQuest: Poisonous Animals: Scorpions| url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C007974/2_4sco.htm | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050403212450/http://library.thinkquest.org/C007974/2_4sco.htm | archivedate=2005-04-03 |year=2000 |accessdate =December 16, 2009}}</ref>

====First aid====
[[First aid]] for scorpion stings is generally [[Symptomatic treatment|symptomatic]]. It includes strong [[Analgesic|analgesia]], either systemic ([[opiate]]s or [[paracetamol]]) or locally applied (such as a [[Cold compression therapy|cold compress]]). [[Hypertensive emergency|Hypertensive crises]] are treated with [[anxiolytic]]s and [[Vasodilation|vasodilators]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Adriaan Hopperus Buma, David G.

====Medical use====
[[File:Deathstalker ST 07.JPG|thumb|The [[deathstalker]] has powerful venom.]]
Short-chain scorpion toxins constitute the largest group of [[potassium]] (K<sup>+</sup>) channel blocking peptides; an important physiological role of the [[KCNA3]] channel, also known as K<sub>V</sub>1.3, is to help maintain large electrical gradients for the sustained transport of ions such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> that controls [[T lymphocyte]] (T cell) proliferation. Thus K<sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers could be potential [[immunosuppressant]]s for the treatment of autoimmune disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis).<ref name="pmid15120495">{{cite journal |author=K.
