'''Sharks''' are a group of [[fish]] characterized by a [[cartilaginous]] [[skeleton]], five to seven [[gill slit]]s on the sides of the head, and [[pectoral fin]]s that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the [[clade]] '''Selachimorpha''' (or '''Selachii''') and are the sister group to the [[Batoidea|rays]]. However, the term "shark" has also been used for extinct members of the subclass [[Elasmobranchii]] outside the Selachimorpha, such as ''[[Cladoselache]]'' and ''[[Xenacanthus]]'', as well as other [[Chondrichthyes]] such as the [[holocephalid]] [[Eugeneodontida|eugenedontidans]]. Under this broader definition, the earliest known sharks date back to more than 420 million years ago.<ref name="RQGT">{{cite web

Since then, sharks have diversified into [[List of sharks|over 500 species]]. They range in size from the small [[dwarf lanternshark]] (''Etmopterus perryi''), a deep sea species of only {{convert|17|cm|in|1}} in length, to the [[whale shark]] (''Rhincodon typus''), the largest fish in the world, which reaches approximately {{convert|12|m|ft|0}} in length. Sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths of {{convert|2000|m|ft|-2}}. They generally do not live in freshwater although there are a few known exceptions, such as the [[bull shark]] and the [[river shark]], which can survive and be found in both seawater and freshwater.<ref>{{cite book

Well-known species such as the [[great white shark]], [[tiger shark]], [[blue shark]], [[Isurus|mako shark]], and the [[hammerhead shark]] are [[apex predator]]s—organisms at the top of their underwater [[food chain]]. Many shark populations are threatened by human activities.

==Etymology==
Until the 16th century,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=shark&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2013-09-07}}</ref> sharks were known to mariners as "sea dogs".<ref>{{cite book

The etymology of the word "shark" is uncertain. One theory is that it derives from the [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya]] word ''xok'', pronounced 'shok'.<ref>{{cite web
| url=http://www.mesoweb.com/pari/publications/RT07/211-Xoc.html
| title=The Xoc, the Sharke, and the Sea Dogs: An Historical Encounter
| last=Jones
| first=Tom
| accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref>
Evidence for this etymology comes from the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], which notes ''shark'' first came into use after Sir [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]]' sailors exhibited one in London in 1569 and posted "''sharke''" to refer to the large sharks of the [[Caribbean Sea]]. However, the [[Middle English Dictionary]] records an isolated occurrence of the word ''shark'' (referring to a sea fish) in a letter written by [[Thomas Beckington]] in 1442, which rules out a New World etymology.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shark|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/m/mec/med-idx?type=id&id=MED39794&egs=all&egdisplay=open|work=Middle English Dictionary|publisher=University of Michigan}}</ref>

An alternate etymology states that the original sense of the word was that of "predator, one who preys on others" from the German ''Schorck'', a variant of ''Schurke'' "villain, scoundrel" (cf. ''card shark'', ''loan shark'', etc.), which was later applied to the fish due to its predatory behaviour.<ref>Online Etymology Dictionary, shark.</ref>

Evidence for the existence of sharks dates from the [[Ordovician]] period, 450–420 million years ago, before land vertebrates existed and before many plants had colonized the continents.<ref name="RQGT"/> Only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks, suspecting that these scales are actually those of [[thelodont]] agnathans.<ref name="RQES">{{cite web

Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. The teeth consist of easily fossilized [[calcium phosphate]], an [[apatite]]. When a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. Preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments.

Among the most ancient and primitive sharks is ''[[Cladoselache]]'', from about 370 million years ago,<ref name="RQA">{{cite web

At that point in Earth's history these rocks made up the soft bottom sediments of a large, shallow ocean, which stretched across much of North America. ''Cladoselache'' was only about {{convert|1|m|ft}} long with stiff triangular fins and slender jaws.<ref name="RQA" /> Its teeth had several pointed cusps, which wore down from use. From the small number of teeth found together, it is most likely that ''Cladoselache'' did not replace its teeth as regularly as modern sharks. Its caudal fins had a similar shape to the [[great white shark]]s and the pelagic [[Shortfin mako shark|shortfin]] and [[Longfin mako shark|longfin makos]]. The presence of whole fish arranged tail-first in their stomachs suggest that they were fast swimmers with great agility.

Most fossil sharks from about 300 to 150 million years ago can be assigned to one of two groups. The [[Xenacanthida]] was almost exclusive to freshwater environments.<ref>[http://hoopermuseum.earthsci.carleton.ca/sharks/P2-3.htm "Xenacanth"]. Hooper Virtual Natural History Museum.

===Taxonomy===
[[File:Extant Shark Orders.svg|right |350px |Identification of the 8 [[Extant taxon|extant]] shark [[order (biology)|orders]]|alt=Branching diagram listing distinguishing characteristics, including mouth, snout, fin spines, etc.]]
Sharks belong to the [[superorder (biology)|superorder]] Selachimorpha in the [[subclass (biology)|subclass]] [[Elasmobranchii]] in the [[Class (biology)|class]] [[Chondrichthyes]]. The Elasmobranchii also include [[Batoidea|rays]] and [[Skate (fish)|skate]]s; the Chondrichthyes also include [[Chimaera]]s. It is currently thought that the sharks form a [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] group: some sharks are more closely related to rays than they are to some other sharks.<ref name="Taxonomy">{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5261e/y5261e08.htm|title=Sharks (Chondrichthyes)|publisher=FAO|accessdate=2009-09-14}}</ref>

The superorder Selachimorpha is divided into Galea (or [[Galeomorphii]]), and Squalea (or [[Squalomorphii]]). The Galeans are the [[Bullhead shark|Heterodontiformes]], [[Carpet shark|Orectolobiformes]], [[Lamniformes]], and [[Carcharhiniformes]]. Lamnoids and Carcharhinoids are usually placed in one [[clade]], but recent studies show the Lamnoids and Orectoloboids are a clade. Some scientists now think that Heterodontoids may be Squalean. The Squaleans are divided into Hexanchoidei and Squalomorpha. The Hexanchoidei includes the [[Hexanchiformes]] and [[Frilled shark|Chlamydoselachiformes]]. The Squalomorpha contains the [[Squaliformes]] and the Hypnosqualea. The Hypnosqualea may be invalid. It includes the [[Angel shark|Squatiniformes]], and the Pristorajea, which may also be invalid, but includes the [[Sawshark|Pristiophoriformes]] and the [[Batoidea]].<ref name="Taxonomy"/><ref name="CompagnoFAO"/>

There are more than 470 species of sharks split across thirteen [[order (biology)|orders]], including four orders of sharks that have gone extinct:<ref name="CompagnoFAO">{{cite web|url=http://www.elasmo.com/frameMe.html?file=selachin/fao/shark_gn.html&menu=bin/menu_topics-alt.html|title=Compagno's FAO Species List - 1984|publisher=Elasmo.com|accessdate=2009-09-14}}</ref>

*[[Carcharhiniformes]]: Commonly known as [[Carcharhiniformes|ground sharks]], the order includes the [[blue shark|blue]], [[tiger shark|tiger]], [[bull shark|bull]], [[grey reef shark|grey reef]], [[blacktip reef shark|blacktip reef]], [[Caribbean reef shark|Caribbean reef]], [[Blacktail reef shark|blacktail reef]], [[whitetip reef shark|whitetip reef]], and [[oceanic whitetip shark]]s (collectively called the [[requiem shark]]s) along with the [[houndshark]]s, [[catshark]]s, and [[hammerhead shark]]s. They are distinguished by an elongated snout and a [[nictitating membrane]] which protects the eyes during an attack.
*[[Bullhead shark|Heterodontiformes]]: They are generally referred to as the [[Bullhead shark|bullhead]] or [[horn shark]]s.

===Teeth===
{{Main|Shark tooth}}
[[File:Tiger shark teeth.jpg|thumb|The teeth of [[tiger shark]]s are oblique and serrated to saw through flesh|alt=The serrated teeth of a [[tiger shark]], used for sawing through flesh]]
Shark teeth are embedded in the [[Gingiva|gums]] rather than directly affixed to the jaw, and are constantly replaced throughout life. Multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove on the inside of the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a [[conveyor belt]]; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. In most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the [[Isistius|cookiecutter shark]].<ref>{{cite web

| title = Teeth of the Skin
| first= R. Aidan |last=Martin
| accessdate = 2007-08-28}}</ref>

Tooth shape depends on the shark's diet: those that feed on [[mollusk]]s and [[crustacean]]s have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as [[mammal]]s have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with [[serration|serrated]] edges for cutting. The teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.<ref name="Gilbertson" />

===Skeleton===
Shark skeletons are very different from those of [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]] and [[tetrapod|terrestrial vertebrates]]. Sharks and other [[chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]] ([[Skate (fish)|skate]]s and [[batoidea|rays]]) have skeletons made of [[cartilage]] and [[connective tissue]]. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy.<ref name="skeletoncorset">{{cite web

|accessdate=August 14, 2009
}}</ref>

===Jaw===
[[Jaw]]s of sharks, like those of rays and skates, are not attached to the [[cranium]]. The jaw's surface (in comparison to the shark's vertebrae and gill arches) needs extra support due to its heavy exposure to physical stress and its need for strength. It has a layer of tiny hexagonal plates called "[[tesserae]]", which are crystal blocks of calcium salts arranged as a mosaic.<ref>{{cite book
| last = Hamlett
| first = W. C.
| title = Sharks, Skates and Rays: The Biology of Elasmobranch Fishes
| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press
| year = 1999f
|isbn= 0-8018-6048-2
| oclc = 39217534}}</ref> This gives these areas much of the same strength found in the bony tissue found in other animals.

Generally sharks have only one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, depending on body size. The jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers.<ref name="skeletoncorset"/> In the [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts.

===Fins===
Fin skeletons are elongated and supported with soft and unsegmented rays named ceratotrichia, filaments of elastic protein resembling the horny keratin in hair and feathers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hamlett|first=William C.|title=Sharks, skates, and rays: the biology of elasmobranch fishes|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=p 56|date=April 23, 1999|edition=1|page=528|isbn=978-0-8018-6048-5|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ON-sPP5rowwC&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=shark+fin++ceratotrichia+supported&q=shark%20fin%20%20ceratotrichia%20supported}}</ref> Most sharks have eight fins. Sharks can only drift away from objects directly in front of them because their fins do not allow them to move in the tail-first direction.<ref name=langoni/>

===Dermal denticles===
{{Main|Dermal denticle}}
[[File:Denticules cutanés du requin citron Negaprion brevirostris vus au microscope électronique à balayage.jpg|thumb|The dermal denticles of a [[lemon shark]], viewed through a [[scanning electron microscope]] |alt=The dermal denticles of a lemon shark]]

Unlike bony fish, sharks have a complex dermal corset made of flexible collagenous fibers and arranged as a helical network surrounding their body. This works as an outer skeleton, providing attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy.<ref name=Cartilagious>{{cite web|url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/topics/p_cartilage.htm|title=The Importance of Being Cartilaginous|last=Martin|first=R.

| accessdate = 2007-08-28}}</ref>

===Tails===
[[Tail]]s provide thrust, making speed and acceleration dependent on tail shape. [[Caudal fin]] shapes vary considerably between shark species, due to their evolution in separate environments. Sharks possess a [[wiktionary:heterocercal|heterocercal]] caudal fin in which the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] portion is usually noticeably larger than the [[ventral]] portion. This is because the shark's [[vertebral column]] extends into that dorsal portion, providing a greater surface area for muscle attachment. This allows more efficient [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] among these negatively buoyant cartilaginous fish. By contrast, most bony fish possess a [[wiktionary:homocercal|homocercal]] caudal fin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fathom.com/course/21701777/session1.html|title=Jaws: The Natural History of Sharks|last=Michael|first=Bright|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref>

Tiger sharks have a large upper [[lobe (anatomy)|lobe]], which allows for slow cruising and sudden bursts of speed. The tiger shark must be able to twist and turn in the water easily when hunting to support its varied diet, whereas the [[Porbeagle|porbeagle shark]], which hunts schooling fish such as [[mackerel]] and [[herring]], has a large lower lobe to help it keep pace with its fast-swimming prey.<ref name="Nelson">{{cite book

| oclc=28965588}}</ref> Other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly, such as the thresher shark's usage of its powerful, elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid.

==Physiology==

===Buoyancy===
Unlike bony fish, sharks do not have gas-filled swim bladders for buoyancy. Instead, sharks rely on a large liver filled with oil that contains [[squalene]], and their cartilage, which is about half the normal density of bone.<ref name=Cartilagious/> Their liver constitutes up to 30% of their total body mass.<ref name="Collins">{{cite book

| publisher=Collins Field Guides
| year=2005
| isbn=0-00-713610-2
| oclc=183136093}}</ref> The liver's effectiveness is limited, so sharks employ [[dynamic lift (fish)|dynamic lift]] to maintain depth when not swimming. [[Sand tiger shark]]s store air in their stomachs, using it as a form of swim bladder. Most sharks need to constantly swim in order to breathe and cannot sleep very long without sinking (if at all). However, certain species, like the [[nurse shark]], are capable of pumping water across their gills, allowing them to rest on the ocean bottom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/education/questions/basics.html#sleep |title=Do sharks sleep |publisher=Flmnh.ufl.edu |accessdate=2010-09-23}}</ref>

Some sharks, if inverted or stroked on the nose, enter a natural state of [[tonic immobility]]. Researchers use this condition to handle sharks safely.<ref name=ParttGruberTaniuchi>{{cite book

===Respiration===
Like other fish, sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their [[gill]]s. Unlike other fish, shark gill slits are not covered, but lie in a row behind the head. A modified slit called a [[spiracle]] lies just behind the eye, which assists the shark with taking in water during [[Aquatic respiration|respiration]] and plays a major role in bottom–dwelling sharks. Spiracles are reduced or missing in active [[pelagic]] sharks.<ref name="Gilbertson">{{cite book

|title = Zoology Laboratory Manual
| publisher = McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
| year = 1999
| location = New York
|isbn= 0-07-237716-X}}</ref> While the shark is moving, water passes through the mouth and over the gills in a process known as "ram ventilation". While at rest, most sharks pump water over their gills to ensure a constant supply of oxygenated water. A small number of species have lost the ability to pump water through their gills and must swim without rest. These species are ''obligate ram ventilators'' and would presumably [[asphyxiate]] if unable to move. Obligate ram ventilation is also true of some pelagic bony fish species.<ref>{{cite web

The respiration and [[Circulatory system|circulation]] process begins when deoxygenated [[blood]] travels to the shark's two-chambered [[heart]]. Here the shark pumps blood to its gills via the ventral [[aorta]] [[artery]] where it branches into [[wikt:afferent#Adjective|afferent]] [[Arm|brachial]] arteries. Reoxygenation takes place in the gills and the reoxygenated blood flows into the [[wikt:efferent#Adjective|efferent]] brachial arteries, which come together to form the [[dorsal aorta]]. The blood flows from the dorsal aorta throughout the body. The deoxygenated blood from the body then flows through the posterior [[cardinal veins]] and enters the posterior cardinal [[Anal sinuses|sinuses]]. From there blood enters the heart [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] and the cycle repeats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/sharks-&-rays/anatomy.htm|title=SHARKS & RAYS, SeaWorld/Busch Gardens ANIMALS, CIRCULATORY SYSTEM|publisher=Busch Entertainment Corporation|accessdate=2009-09-03}}</ref>

===Thermoregulation===
Most sharks are "cold-blooded" or, more precisely, [[poikilotherm]]ic, meaning that their internal [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]] matches that of their ambient environment. Members of the family [[Lamnidae]] (such as the [[shortfin mako shark]] and the [[great white shark]]) are [[homeothermy|homeothermic]] and maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water. In these sharks, a strip of [[aerobic metabolism|aerobic]] red muscle located near the center of the body generates the heat, which the body retains via a [[countercurrent exchange]] mechanism by a system of [[blood vessel]]s called the [[rete mirabile]] ("miraculous net"). The [[common thresher|common thresher shark]] has a similar mechanism for maintaining an elevated body temperature, which is thought to have evolved independently{{Failed verification|date=November 2010}}.<ref>{{cite web

===Osmoregulation===
In contrast to bony fish, with the exception of the [[coelacanth]],<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/35431 Chemistry of the body fluids of the coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae]</ref> the blood and other tissue of sharks and [[Chondrichthyes]] is generally [[Isotonicity|isotonic]] to their marine environments because of the high concentration of [[urea]] (up to 2.5%<ref>http://www.sharkproject.org/haiothek/index_e.php?site=anatomie_2</ref>) and [[trimethylamine]] N-oxide (TMAO), allowing them to be in [[osmotic]] balance with the seawater. This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater, and they are therefore confined to [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] environments. A few exceptions exist, such as the [[bull shark]], which has developed a way to change its [[kidney]] function to excrete large amounts of urea.<ref name="Collins" /> When a shark dies, the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria, causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia.<ref>{{cite web

===Digestion===
Digestion can take a long time. The food moves from the mouth to a J-shaped stomach, where it is stored and initial digestion occurs.<ref name="Digestion">{{cite web
|url=http://elasmo-research.org/education/white_shark/digestion.htm
|title=No Guts, No Glory
|last=Martin|first=R. Aidan
|publisher=ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research
|accessdate=2009-08-22}}</ref> Unwanted items may never get past the stomach, and instead the shark either vomits or turns its stomachs inside out and ejects unwanted items from its mouth.

One of the biggest differences between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines. This short length is achieved by the [[spiral valve]] with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube-like intestine. The valve provides a long surface area, requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested, when remaining waste products pass into the [[cloaca]].<ref name="Digestion"/>

==Senses==

===Smell===
[[File:Hammerhead shark.jpg|thumb |240px |The shape of the [[hammerhead shark]]'s head may enhance olfaction by spacing the nostrils further apart.|alt=Eyelevel photo of hammerhead from the front]]
Sharks have keen [[olfactory]] senses, located in the short duct (which is not fused, unlike bony fish) between the anterior and posterior nasal openings, with some species able to detect as little as one [[parts per million|part per million]] of blood in seawater.<ref>{{cite web

|title=Smell and Taste

Sharks have the ability to determine the direction of a given scent based on the timing of scent detection in each nostril.<ref>[http://shell.cas.usf.edu/motta/Gardiner%20and%20Atema%202010.pdf The Function of Bilateral Odor Arrival Time Differences in Olfactory Orientation of Sharks], Jayne M. Gardiner, Jelle Atema, Current Biology - 13 July 2010 (Vol. 20, Issue 13, pp. 1187-1191)</ref> This is similar to the method mammals use to determine direction of sound.

They are more attracted to the chemicals found in the intestines of many species, and as a result often linger near or in [[sewage]] outfalls. Some species, such as [[nurse shark]]s, have external [[barbels]] that greatly increase their ability to sense prey.

===Sight===
[[File:Hexanchus nakamurai JNC2615 Eye.JPG|thumb|left|Eye of a [[Bigeyed sixgill shark]] (''Hexanchus nakamurai'')]]
Shark [[eye]]s are similar to the eyes of other [[vertebrates]], including similar [[lens (anatomy)|lenses]], [[cornea]]s and [[retina]]s, though their eyesight is well adapted to the [[ocean|marine]] environment with the help of a tissue called [[tapetum lucidum]]. This tissue is behind the [[retina]] and reflects light back to it, thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters. The effectiveness of the tissue varies, with some sharks having stronger [[nocturnal]] adaptations. Many sharks can contract and dilate their [[pupil]]s, like humans, something no [[teleost fish]] can do. Sharks have eyelids, but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes. To protect their eyes some species have [[nictitating membrane]]s. This membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked. However, some species, including the [[great white shark]] (''Carcharodon carcharias''), do not have this membrane, but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey. The importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated. Some believe that [[electroreception|electro-]] and [[chemoreception]] are more significant, while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important. Presumably, the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant. The use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions. The shark's field of vision can swap between [[monocular]] and [[stereoscopic]] at any time.<ref>{{cite web

===Reproduction===
Unlike most [[bony fish]], sharks are [[r/K selection theory|K-selected]] reproducers, meaning that they produce a small number of well-developed young as opposed to a large number of poorly developed young.

====Sexual====
Sharks practice [[internal fertilization]]. The posterior part of a male shark's pelvic fins are modified into a pair of [[intromittent organ]]s called [[clasper]]s, analogous to a [[mammalian penis]], of which one is used to deliver [[sperm]] into the female.<ref name="Mating">{{cite web
|url=http://elasmo-research.org/education/topics/lh_2penises.htm
|title=Why Do Sharks Have Two Penises?
|last=Martin
|first=R. Aidan
|publisher=ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research
|accessdate=2009-08-22}}</ref>

[[Mating]] has rarely been observed in sharks. The smaller [[catshark]]s often mate with the male curling around the female. In less flexible species the two sharks swim parallel to each other while the male inserts a clasper into the female's [[oviduct]]. Females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during [[mating]]. The bite marks may also come from courtship behavior: the male may bite the female to show his interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.<ref name="Mating"/>

====Asexual====
There are two documented cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a pup on her own through [[parthenogenesis]].<ref>{{cite journal

The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown, as is whether other species have this capability. Mammals are now the only major [[vertebrate]] group in which [[asexual reproduction]] has not been observed.

Scientists say that asexual reproduction in the wild is rare, and probably a last-ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present. Asexual reproduction diminishes [[genetic diversity]], which helps build defenses against threats to the species. Species that rely solely on it risk extinction. Asexual reproduction may have contributed to the [[blue shark]]'s decline off the [[Ireland|Irish]] coast.<ref>{{cite news

===Brooding===
Sharks display three ways to bear their young, varying by species, [[oviparity]], [[Viviparous|viviparity]] and [[ovoviviparity]].<ref name="Birth">{{cite web|url=http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/sharks-&-rays/birth-&-care.htm|title=SHARKS & RAYS, SeaWorld/Busch Gardens ANIMALS, BIRTH & CARE OF YOUNG|publisher=Busch Entertainment Corporation|accessdate=2009-09-03}}</ref>

====Ovoviviparity====
Most sharks are [[ovoviviparous]], meaning that the eggs hatch in the [[oviduct]] within the mother's body and that the egg's [[yolk]] and fluids secreted by glands in the walls of the oviduct nourishes the embryos. The young continue to be nourished by the remnants of the yolk and the oviduct's fluids. As in viviparity, the young are born alive and fully functional. [[Lamniforme]] sharks practice ''[[oophagy]]'', where the first embryos to hatch eat the remaining eggs.  Taking this a step further,  [[sand tiger shark]] pups cannibalistically consume neighboring embryos.  The survival strategy for ovoviviparous species is to [[offspring|brood]] the young to a comparatively large size before birth. The [[whale shark]] is now classified as ovoviviparous rather than oviparous, because extrauterine eggs are now thought to have been aborted. Most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas, including bays, river mouths and shallow reefs. They choose such areas for protection from predators (mainly other sharks) and the abundance of food. [[Squalidae|Dogfish]] have the longest known [[gestation period]] of any shark, at 18 to 24 months. [[Basking shark]]s and [[frilled shark]]s appear to have even longer gestation periods, but accurate data are lacking.<ref name="Birth"/>

====Oviparity====
Some species are [[oviparous]] like most other fish, laying their eggs in the water. In most oviparous shark species, an [[Egg case (Chondrichthyes)|egg case]] with the consistency of [[leather]] protects the developing embryo(s). These cases may be corkscrewed into crevices for protection. Once empty, the egg case is known as a ''[[mermaid's purse]]'', and  can wash up on shore. Oviparous sharks include the [[horn shark]], [[catshark]], [[Port Jackson shark]], and [[swellshark]].<ref name="Birth"/><ref>{{cite web

|title=Marine Biology notes
|publisher=School of Life Sciences, [[Napier University]]
|accessdate=2006-09-12}}</ref>

====Viviparity====
Finally some sharks maintain a ''[[placenta]]l'' link to the developing young, this method is called viviparity. This is more analogous to mammalian gestation than that of other fishes. The young are born alive and fully functional. Hammerheads, the [[requiem sharks]] (such as the [[bull shark|bull]] and [[blue shark]]s), and [[smoothhound]]s are viviparous.<ref name="FAO" /><ref name="Birth"/>

==Behavior==
The classic view describes a solitary hunter, ranging the oceans in search of food. However, this applies to only a few species. Most live far more social, sedentary, [[benthic]] lives, and appear likely to have their own distinct personalities.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/the-truth-about-sharks-far-from-being-killing-machines-they-have-personalities-best-friends-and-an-exceptional-capacity-for-learning-9887898.html The truth about sharks: Far from being 'killing machines', they have personalities, best friends and an exceptional capacity for learning] (2014-11-28), ''[[The Independent]]''</ref> Even solitary sharks meet for breeding or at rich hunting grounds, which may lead them to cover thousands of miles in a year.<ref>{{cite news

Sharks can be highly social, remaining in large schools. Sometimes more than 100 [[scalloped hammerhead]]s congregate around [[seamount]]s and islands, e.g., in the [[Gulf of California]].<ref name="Collins" /> Cross-species social hierarchies exist. For example, [[oceanic whitetip shark]]s dominate [[silky shark]]s of comparable size during feeding.<ref name="FAO"/>

===Sleep===
All sharks need to keep water flowing over their gills in order for them to breathe, however not all species need to be moving to do this. Those that are able to breathe while not swimming breathe by using their [[spiracle]]s to force water over their gills, thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water. It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them<ref name="Sleep"/> and as such they are not truly asleep.

Species that do need to swim continuously to breathe go through a process known as sleep swimming, in which the shark is essentially unconscious. It is known from experiments conducted on the [[spiny dogfish]] that its [[spinal cord]], rather than its brain, coordinates swimming, so [[spiny dogfish]] can continue to swim while sleeping, and this also may be the case in larger shark species.<ref name="Sleep">{{cite web

===Feeding===
{{About|shark feeding|the sport of shark feeding|Shark baiting|section=yes}}

Most sharks are [[carnivorous]].<ref name="Feeding"/> [[Basking shark]]s, [[whale shark]]s, and [[megamouth shark]]s have independently evolved different strategies for filter feeding [[plankton]]: basking sharks practice [[ram feeding]], whale sharks use suction to take in plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make [[suction feeding]] more efficient by using the [[luminescent]] tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. This type of feeding requires [[gill raker]]s—long, slender filaments that form a very efficient [[sieve]]—analogous to the [[baleen]] plates of the [[great whale]]s. The shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows from time to time in huge mouthfuls. Teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding.<ref name="Feeding">{{cite web

[[File:Surfacing great white shark.jpg|Like many sharks, the great white shark is an [[apex predator]] in its environment.|thumb|left|alt=Photo of great white on surface with open jaws revealing meal.]]

Other highly specialized feeders include [[cookiecutter shark]]s, which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and [[marine mammal]]s. Cookiecutter teeth are enormous compared to the animal's size. The lower teeth are particularly sharp. Although they have never been observed feeding, they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal, twisting their bodies to rip off flesh.<ref name="Collins" />

Some seabed–dwelling species are highly effective ambush predators. [[Angel shark]]s and [[wobbegong]]s use camouflage to lie in wait and suck prey into their mouths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elasmo-research.org/education/shark_profiles/orectolobiformes.htm|title=Order Orectolobiformes: Carpet Sharks—39 species|last=Martin|first=R. Aidan|publisher=ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research|accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref> Many [[benthic]] sharks feed solely on [[crustacean]]s which they crush with their flat [[molar (tooth)|molariform]] teeth.

Other sharks feed on [[squid]] or fish, which they swallow whole. The [[viper dogfish]] has teeth it can point outwards to strike and capture prey that it then swallows intact. The [[great white shark|great white]] and other large predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals. [[Thresher shark]]s use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes, and [[sawshark]]s either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth-studded [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostra]].

Many sharks, including the [[whitetip reef shark]] are cooperative feeders and hunt in packs to herd and capture elusive prey. These social sharks are often migratory, traveling huge distances around [[ocean basin]]s in large schools. These migrations may be partly necessary to find new food sources.<ref>{{harvnb|Stevens|1987}}</ref>

In 2006 the [[International Shark Attack File]] (ISAF) undertook an investigation into 96 alleged shark attacks, confirming 62 of them as unprovoked attacks and 16 as provoked attacks. The average number of fatalities worldwide per year between 2001 and 2006 from unprovoked shark attacks is 4.3.<ref>{{cite web

Contrary to popular belief, only a few sharks are dangerous to humans. Out of more than 470 species, only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the [[great white shark|great white]], [[oceanic whitetip shark|oceanic whitetip]], [[tiger shark|tiger]], and [[bull shark]]s.<ref name="isaf">{{cite web

The perception of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularized by publicity given to a few isolated unprovoked attacks, such as the [[Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916]], and through popular fictional works about shark attacks, such as the ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' film series. ''Jaws'' author [[Peter Benchley]], as well as [[Jaws (film)|''Jaws'']] director [[Steven Spielberg]] later attempted to dispel the image of sharks as man-eating monsters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/06/0606_shark5.html|title=Jaws Author Peter Benchley Talks Sharks|last=Handwerk|first=Brian|date=7 June 2002|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref>

To help avoid an unprovoked attack, humans should not wear jewelry or metal that is shiny and refrain from splashing around too much.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130704-shark-attack-prevention-response-ocean-beach-animal-science/ |title=How Should We Respond When Humans and Sharks Collide? |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2013-07-04 |accessdate=2013-09-07}}</ref>

===In captivity===
{{Main|Sharks in captivity}}
Until recently only a few [[benthic]] species of shark, such as [[Horn shark|hornsharks]], [[leopard shark]]s and [[catshark]]s had survived in aquarium conditions for a year or more. This gave rise to the belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care for. More knowledge has led to more species (including the large [[pelagic]] sharks) living far longer in captivity. At the same time, safer transportation techniques have enabled long distance movement.<ref>{{cite web

===In Hawaii===
Sharks figure prominently in [[Hawaiian mythology]]. Stories tell of men with shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form. A common theme was that a shark-man would warn beach-goers of sharks in the waters. The beach-goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark-man who warned them. [[Hawaii]]an mythology also includes many shark [[god]]s. Among a fishing people, the most popular of all [[aumakua]], or deified ancestor guardians, are shark aumakua. [[Kamaku]] describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark. The body transforms gradually until the [[kahuna]] can point the awe-struck family to the markings on the shark's body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloved's body had been wrapped. Such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet, receiving food, and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger. Like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies. The ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery. Many Native Hawaiian families claim such an aumakua, who is known by name to the whole community.<ref>{{cite web

===In popular culture===
{{Main|Sharks in popular culture}}
In contrast to the complex portrayals by Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, the European and Western view of sharks has historically been mostly of fear and malevolence.<ref name=Dean>{{cite book|author=Crawford, Dean|year=2008|title=Shark|publisher=Reaktion Books|pages=47–55|isbn=978-1861893253}}</ref> Sharks are used in popular culture commonly as eating machines, notably in the ''[[Jaws (novel)|Jaws]]'' novel and the [[Jaws (film)|film of the same name]], along with its [[Jaws (franchise)#Films|sequels]]. Sharks are threats in other films such as ''[[Deep Blue Sea (1999 film)|Deep Blue Sea]]'', ''[[The Reef (2010 film)|The Reef]]'', and [[List of killer shark films|others]], although they are sometimes used for comedic effect such as in ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and the ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]'' series. These comedic effects can sometimes be unintentional, as seen in ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman: The Movie]]'' and various [[Syfy]] channel films like ''[[Dinoshark]]'' and ''[[Sharktopus]]''.

Sharks tend to be seen quite often in cartoons whenever a scene involves the ocean. Such examples include the ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, ''[[Jabberjaw]]'', and other shows produced by Hanna-Barbera. They also are used commonly as a clichéd means of killing off a character that is held up by a rope or some similar object as the sharks swim right below them, or the character may be standing on a [[Walking the plank|plank]] above shark infested waters.
